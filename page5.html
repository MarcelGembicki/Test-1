<h3> The best holiday of all time is definetly Halloween. You get candy and fun times wiht friends, I think the best part of Halloween is scaring people. I love to scare people, especially people that scare easily because after that they get mad at you but laugh it off. </p>

<div class="halloween"
<h3> Traditionally on halloween me and my friends go trick or treating at night, then when no one is trick or treating anymore we go to the houses with bowls and take all the candy. When we got all the candy we go ding-dong ditch the houses, that's is why halloween is the best holiday. </p>
